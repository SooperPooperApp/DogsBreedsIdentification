# DogsBreedsIdentification
Identification of a dog breed based on Machine Learning

This project has two parts.

TensorFlow model and “Web API” for the prediction dogs breed.

# Model:
Stored in the directory "model".

BreedsModel.ipynb – file for training model in the Jupyter Notebok.
The scipt based on the Stanford Dogs Dataset except that added 6 new breads and save model to the “breeds_model126.h5” in the current directory.
Model based on the pretained model AlexNet. Directory **"input"** in the script location must contains train dataset. 
For restriction reason of the size on the git repository, dataset stored externally in the http://134.249.147.120/DogBreeds/ImageBreeds/

TODO - Requires an approved storage in a archive

TODO "Web API"

Scipt tested on python3.8 and python3.9 on ubuntu and gentoo.
